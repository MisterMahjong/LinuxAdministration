This runs, creates a new daily log if one doesnt exist, 
appends a new entry with the current users from line 35 (users, doesnt include daemons) down. Each time
a new entry is made, the time of the screenshot is appended to the file and the list is printed. This file should be created 
as root and assigned with the SUID in order to run through the chrontab. 

#!/bin/bash
set `date`
echo "$4" >> /var/log/UserShot$2$3$6
awk -F ":" '{if(NR>=35) print "User:"$1 " Location:"$6}' /etc/passwd >> /var/log/UserShot$2$3$6

Crontab was edited to include the path to the script, as well as commands to run every 30 minutes.
