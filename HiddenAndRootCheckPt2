Note: This script is only partially complete. It will run and create a file for the day, showing complete lists of 
hidden files and root executables. In order to check whether they've been modified however, one must run the final line for the 
files/executables in question.

echo “List of hidden files on this server”
find / -type f -iname ".*" -ls >> /var/log/HiddenFiles$2$3$6
echo “ “
echo “List of SUID’d executables on this server”  >> /var/log/HiddenFiles$2$3$6
find /bin -perm -4000  

To check the last modified time for a file use the following command:

stat usershot  | awk '{if(NR == 8)print}'
