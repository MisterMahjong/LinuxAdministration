Below is a script that, when run, will create a daily snapshot of the servers "health", tracking various outputs of handy commands, and keeping them
in a special healthlog folder I created in the etc directory. This could easily be set to run as an automated task using crontab. 


#!/bin/bash
set `date`
echo "System Hard Disk Information" > /etc/healthlog/"Health$2-$3-$4"
df | awk '{print  $1, $5}' >> /etc/healthlog/"Health$2-$3-$4"
echo " " >> /etc/healthlog/"Health$2-$3-$4"
echo "Snapshot of CPU usage at this time" >> /etc/healthlog/"Health$2-$3-$4"
mpstat >> /etc/healthlog/"Health$2-$3-$4"
echo " " >> /etc/healthlog/"Health$2-$3-$4"
echo "System Memory Utilization at this time" >> /etc/healthlog/"Health$2-$3-$4"
free >> /etc/healthlog/"Health$2-$3-$4"
echo " " >> /etc/healthlog/"Health$2-$3-$4"
echo "Snapshot of running processes when this snapshot was taken" >> /etc/healthlog/"Health$2-$3-$4"
ps -aux >> /etc/healthlog/"Health$2-$3-$4"
