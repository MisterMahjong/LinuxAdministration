For this directory integrity process to work, there are TWO scripts below that need to be run. 


#For the script below, an MD5 hash is kept in a var directory called "dirhash", here, "good/valid"
#hashes of verified directories are kept, the script below will check a directories MD5SUM hash
#output against the file and return if the directory is unchanged, or something is different. 

PART I : Creating the Control 
#!/bin/bash
echo "Name the directory you wish to create a control hash for"
read dirname
tar -c $dirname | gzip -n>12345.tgz
md5sum 12345.tgz | awk '{print $1}' > $dirname"Control"
rm 12345.tgz
cp $dirname"Control" /var/dirhash/$dirname"Control"
rm $dirname"Control"

PART II : The Check 
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter the directory you with to verify"
read dirname
thegood=$(</var/dirhash/$dirname"Control")
tar -c $dirname | gzip -n>712112.tgz
md5sum 712112.tgz | awk '{print $1}' > /tmp/thetest
thetest=$(</tmp/thetest)
echo "$thegood"
echo "$thetest"
if [ $thegood == $thetest ]
then
        echo "No changes detected"
fi
if [ $thegood != $thetest ]
then
        echo "This directory has been altered"
fi
rm /tmp/thetest
rm 712112.tgz
